		<p1>The purpose of this assignment was to plan out a program in basic psuedocode. This wouldn't entail any actual coding, but would help us develop a
			process to coding</p1>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p1>Some of the problems we experienced while working on this Lab was related to the instructions for the Lab and not the lab itself. </p1>

	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p1>The psuedocode ideas we have are for Drawing on a tablet, and playing a game of rock paper scissors against a bot. The idea of Drawing on a tablet was
		what would the process of someone drawing on a tablet would be like and that exactly what we did. There's generaly something you sketch, refine, detail, and
		layer.</p1>
		<pre><code>
			//Drawin on a Tablet code:
			//Draw a small “thumbnail” sketch
			//Sketch over the thumbnail
			//Add more, rough details
			//Create a lineart layer
				//Add flat colors
			//Render the picture
				//Add shading
				//Add lighting

			//Rock, Paper, Scissors code:
			//Print the options for the game
			//1 - Rock
			//2 - Paper
			//3 - Scissors
			//Ask users input for which one they would like to pick
			//Verify that the input is correct, otherwise loop back to 2
			//Bot
			//Randomly picks a number between 1-3
			//1 - rock
			//2 - paper
			//3 - scissors
			//Print the winner is based on who won with these parameters
			//Rock
			//Rock beats paper
			//Paper
			//Paper beats rock
			//Scissors
			//Scissors beats paper
			//Draw - both input value are the same
			//Loop back to 2
			//Ask the user if they want to replay
			//If yes loop back to 1
			//If no end the game
