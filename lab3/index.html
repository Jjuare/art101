			<h1>Lab Purpose</h1>
			<p>The Purpose of this lab was to create a homepage for my HTML with hyperlinks to the labs themselves.</p>
			<h1>Challenges</h1>
			<p>The challeneges I experienced were that I didn't remember some of the things that we had learned and I
				had to ask my partner who fortunaly is fortunaly more experienced with coding and was able to answer
				my questions.</p>
			<h1>Results</h1>
			<p>The files were already made I just need to duplicate them for as many labs we have, but the main HTML
				now links to the other relevant ones as seen below.</p>
